Today I hope to extract the table of In-n-Out locations from Po Chun Rich Lee's thesis into an easy-to-use .csv file.

# Using tabulizer

(from:  http://bxhorn.com/2016/extract-data-tables-from-pdf-files-in-r/)

These `tabulizer` packages required 64-bit Java installation.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tabulizer)
library(tabulizerjars)
```

These libraries have functions that allow us to extract the tables from the PDF.  From there, I looked at the data and determined that the table I wanted to start with the 18th in the list.

```{r}
pdf_file <- "RichLee_Thesis.pdf"
pdf_data <- extract_tables(pdf_file)
in_n_out_df <- pdf_data[[18]][2:46,]
colnames(in_n_out_df) <- pdf_data[[18]][1,]
head(in_n_out_df)
```

Now I will write the data to a .csv file.

```{r}
write.csv(in_n_out_df, "in_n_out_df_draft.csv")
```
